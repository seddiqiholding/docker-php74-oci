## Enable URL rewriting
#<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
#    RewriteEngine On
#
#    # Base directory for your project
#    RewriteBase /RetailPOS_APIGateway/
#
#    # Rewrite dynamic versioned routes (v1, v2, v28, etc.)
#    # RewriteRule ^(v[0-9]+/.+)$ $1.php [L]
#
#    # Ignore existing files and directories
#    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
#    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
#
#    # Redirect all other requests to index.php
#    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
#</IfModule>

#Explanation of Changes:
# RewriteBase /RetailPOS_APIGateway/:
#
#Limits the rewrite rules to the RetailPOS_APIGateway directory.
#RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f:
#
#Ensures the server serves existing files directly (e.g., style.css or script.js).
#RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d:
#
#Ensures the server serves existing directories directly.
#RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]:
#
#Routes all other requests to index.php.
#QSA appends query strings.
#L ensures no further rules are processed.
#How It Works:
#Requests like http://172.150.2.73/RetailPOS_APIGateway/v1/employee will be routed to index.php.
#Requests to static files (e.g., http://172.150.2.73/RetailPOS_APIGateway/assets/logo.png) will bypass index.php.



#Testing
#Place the .htaccess file in the RetailPOS_APIGateway directory.
#Ensure that mod_rewrite is enabled in your Apache server:
#bash
#Copy code
#a2enmod rewrite
#systemctl restart apache2
#Test:
#Dynamic Endpoint:
#http://172.150.2.73/RetailPOS_APIGateway/v1/employee should display your routed response.
#Static File:
#http://172.150.2.73/RetailPOS_APIGateway/assets/style.css should serve the file directly.
#This configuration ensures that routing only affects the RetailPOS_APIGateway project, leaving other projects unaffected.
